**User Management Automation**

**Overview**

            This repository contains a series of simple TestNG automation test scripts 
            that I executed as part of my learning journey. 
            The tests cover various basic features of TestNG, including 
            test groups, dependencies, parameterization, and logging.

This project and its code are intended for educational purposes and have been committed to GitHub as part of the learning process.
            
**Technologies used**

            Java – Programming language for the test scripts.
            selenium -  A powerful tool for automating web applications
            TestNG – Testing framework used to create and execute the test scripts.
            
**What I Learned**

            TestNG Basics: How to organize and run tests using TestNG.
            Test Dependencies: How to set up test dependencies in TestNG.
            Test Parameterization: How to pass parameters to test methods.
            Test Groups: How to categorize and run specific groups of tests.
